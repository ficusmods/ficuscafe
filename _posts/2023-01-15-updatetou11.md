My B&S mods -- with the exception of Acid Spell and Force Physics have been updated to U11.
You can find the downloads in the Mods section.  

**Dungeon Configurator** in particular had a lot of fixes and a few new features added, namely:
 * Reworked the spawning logic so enemies no longer spawn on top of each other and the game doesn't freeze when the level is loaded.
 * Added an apply button
 * Container merging. You can now select multiple containers which will be merged together.
 * Wave editor feature improved a lot and there is a new Duel wave

**Non-Snapping limbs** fixed the issue with enemies getting stuck trying to pick their weapons back up.

**Force Physics** became redundant since the physics culling got a lot better.  

**Acid Spell**, I will rework in the future to work differently. This spell was intended as a way to deal with Undying enemies but the
enemies themselves still need work. This mod will be released in the future in some other form.
